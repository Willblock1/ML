# ML

This is a repository that contains the fields of study and projects that I have found useful in the ML space. I have spent over 3 years exploring data science and building algorithms for a variety of purposes. I am passionate about using algorithms to help make better business decisions to improve the bottom line. I have a certification from AWS in Machine Learning (Specialty) and have spent years studying a wide variety of tools and algorithms (classification, regression, forecasting, NLP and image processing).
